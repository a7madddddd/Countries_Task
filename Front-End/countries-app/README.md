# Country Management System

## üìå Overview
This project is a **Country Management System** built using **Clean Layered Architecture** in .NET Core (Backend) and Angular (Frontend).  
It allows users to **add, edit, delete, search, filter, and sort countries** with **soft delete** functionality and a **responsive frontend UI**.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview
The solution follows **Clean Architecture** principles and consists of **4 layers**:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Domain Layer
- **Purpose:** Holds the core business logic and rules.
- **Contents:**
  - **Entities:** Defines the main data structures (e.g., `Country` entity).
  - **DTOs:** Data Transfer Objects for communication between layers.
  - **Interfaces:** Contracts for repository patterns.
  
---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Application Layer
- **Purpose:** Contains application-specific logic and service implementations.
- **Contents:**
  - Not yet fully implemented in this version ‚Äî future work includes adding more services and CQRS pattern.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Infrastructure Layer
- **Purpose:** Handles data access and persistence.
- **Contents:**
  - **DbContext:** Manages database connections and entity configurations.
  - **Repositories:** Implements the repository interfaces from Domain.
  - **Soft Delete Implementation:** Adds a `IsDeleted` flag to entities and filters queries to exclude deleted items.
  - EF Core configurations for entities.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ API Layer
- **Purpose:** Exposes the application functionality through RESTful endpoints.
- **Contents:**
  - **Controllers:** Handle HTTP requests and responses.
  - **Error Handling Middleware:** Standardizes error responses.
  - Endpoints for:
    - `GET /countries` ‚Äî Retrieve list with search, filter, and sorting.
    - `POST /countries` ‚Äî Add new country.
    - `PUT /countries/{id}` ‚Äî Update country.
    - `DELETE /countries/{id}` ‚Äî Soft delete country.

## üñ•Ô∏è Frontend (Angular)
- **Purpose:** Provides a responsive UI for managing countries.
- **Features Implemented:**
  - **List View:** Displays paginated list of countries.
  - **Add / Edit Forms:** Validates input and shows success/error toasts.
  - **Search & Filter:** Allows filtering by name, code, and date.
  - **Sorting:** Clickable table headers to sort by name, code, or date.
  - **Soft Delete:** Deleted countries are hidden without permanent removal.
  - **Toast Notifications:** Success, error, and confirmation messages.
  - **Delete Confirmation Toast:** Custom styled confirmation before deletion.

## üöÄ How to Run the Project

### Backend:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Configure **appsettings.json** with your database connection string.
3. Run EF Core migrations:
   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update


Db :
CREATE TABLE Countries (
    Id INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    Name NVARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    Code NVARCHAR(5) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    CreatedDate DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT GETDATE(),
    IsDeleted BIT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
);

CREATE INDEX IX_Countries_Name ON Countries(Name);
CREATE INDEX IX_Countries_Code ON Countries(Code);
CREATE INDEX IX_Countries_IsDeleted ON Countries(IsDeleted);
